**The Unix Shell Project**

The Unix Shell project is an implementation of a simple UNIX commandline interepretor program (simple\_shell) for Unix-like systems using the C programming language.

This shell program (simple\_shell) provides provisions to:
* Handle command lines with commands
* Handle command lines with arguments
* Handle the _PATH_
* Implement the _exit_ built-in, that exits the shell
* Implement the _env_ built-in, that prints the current environment

Apart from that, to dive deeper into the inner working of a UNIX shell when executing commands such as the _ls -l *c_ command, click the link below for a more detailed explanation of processes involved.
